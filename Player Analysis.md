# Player analysis

## 3 point shooting


<img src='./images/3 point shooting.jpg' />


Ayush Singh and Sadhish Pradhan standout with their 3 point shooting. Combining volume with efficiency. They are the only players to make more than 40% of threes among players who took more than 30 threes in the season.

Saurav Shrestha and Rabin Khatri may not have the efficiency of the aforementioned two players but they are well above the league average.

Rabin Gautam stands out but for the wrong reasons. He has taken the same amount of 3s as Rabin Khatri (league high), but he only made them at a measly 16%.

## 2 point shooting

Players like Ayush Singh, Sidhant Maharjan are very efficient from inside the 3 point line, but they don't really have the volume to truly make much impact.

Sadhish and Saurav have taken the most shots, in the league and make it slightly above the league average.

The players that are interesting here are Ram Krishna Ghatane and Rabin Khatri. Very efficient for the amount of 2 point shots, which we  will see later as well.

## Free Throw shooting

The free throw shooting is a pretty low bar in the NBL with the average FT% only around 55%.

Being a good 3 point shooter is a good indicator for FT shooting as well, and we see Ayush Singh and Sadish maintaining good percentages here as well. 

Meanwhile Saurav Shrestha, who earns a lot of trips to the line, due to his barraging drives inside, drops a lot of points, due to his average FT shooting.

## Assist to Turnover ratio

Assist to turnover ratio is one of the most basic metrics to measure the efficiency of a playmaker. We see Bijay Burja and Rabin Khatri neck to neck in this category as their names overlap in the far right.

Sadish, Minesh and Saurav were players who managed more turnovers than assists, which is a poor sign in terms of keeping hold of the possession.

The most surprising thing was the low amount of assists as even the best playemakers had less than 5 assists per game in the league.

## Where do players get their points from?

Let's look at where the top scorers of the NBL season got their points from:

I have only looked at the players that are interesting and stand out. For the top 10 players, you can check the [player_scoring_pie]('./player_scoring_pie') folder.

1. Saurav Shrestha (First in scoring):

Saurav Shrestha is a dominant player, who relies on his drives. Although he is a better than average 3 point shooter, he is only slightly above the league average in the 2 points and FT department. If he figures out how to be efficient with the volume of usage and shots he takes, he would be truly terrifying. Another caveat here on why his efficiency is low could be because how much his team relies on him. Surround him with better players and he could be taking better shots which result in higher FG%.

2. Sadhish Pradhan (Second in scoring):

 Sadhish is one of the best 3 point shooters in the league, but his efficiency inside the 3 point line could definitely improve. Known to take and make tough shots, he would be even more unstoppable if he can make 2s at a higher rate like his 3 point shooting.

3. Rabin Khatri (Fourth in scoring):

While topping the assist charts, Rabin also is 4th in the scoring leaders. Despite his dimunitive frame, he is a force on the inside, frequently beating his man with his flashy crossovers and getting easy layups at the rim. Although his 3 point shooting may not be very good, he is one of the league's best finishers in and around the rim, making more than 60% of his drives inside.

4. Ayush Singh (Fifth in scoring):

<img src='./player_scoring_pie/Ayush Singh.jpg' />

Ayush Singh is the best 3 point shooter in the league. He has both volume and efficiency to back that claim and is the only player in the top 10 who has scored from outside the 3 point line than from the inside. He has also taken more 3s than 2s, the only player on this list to do so.

He's taken the mantra '3s are greater than 2s' to his heart, and we can't really complain when he makes them at a league high 43% clip.

5. Ram Krishna Ghatane (9th in scoring):

<img src='./player_scoring_pie/Ram Krishna Ghatane.jpg' />

If you have watched Ghatane play, you will see a very similar pattern. He posts up at the right block, and when fed the ball, makes a spin move to get an easy shot at the bucket. He is the most efficient 2 point scorers in the league for players who have taken more than 75 shots and almost all of his shots come from there. He only took one shot from 3 and actually made it, but it is on the inside, where the Army man earns his money.

## Frontcourt dominance

Bikram Joshi, a legend of Nepal basketball, was very important to Times winning the league and he tops both the blocks and rebounding chart. Ajay Kushawa was also a monster on the inside for swatting shots away.

There really aren't rebounding/blocks numbers that stand out after this. Probably owing to the lack of height difference in Nepal's game where usually players are around similar height and stature.
