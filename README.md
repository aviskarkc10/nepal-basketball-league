# Data analysis for Nepal Basketball League 2019

A look at some of the interesting data points from NBL 2019.

Disclaimer: There really is very limited data for the NBL season. The data also doesn't look at the game state, for example, taking a 3 point shot in the 4th quarter when your team is down by 4 versus taking it when your team is up by 10 is of course different. The stats are also not minutes/possession adjusted, which would have given better insight into the data.
