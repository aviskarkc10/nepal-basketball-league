## 3 point shooting

TAC are unsurprisingly at the top here. They take the most 3s and also make the most 3s. NPC, Times and GGIC are at the middle of the pack with similar numbers. But this chart shows a worrying sign for South Siders. They chucked the most 3s in the league, but made it at a horrible rate of only 20%.


## 2 point shooting

TAC had 2 of the most efficient inside scorers in the league in Ram Krishna Ghatane and Rabin Khatri. So it's not surprise they are at the top of the list again. South Siders are once again at the bottom of this list and it's no surprise they had such a disappointing season. Last in both 3 point and 2 point efficiency.

## Free throw shooting

Finally something positive about South Siders, they managed to get to the free throw line more than 50 times than their closest opponents, and made more than the league average. Royal and Kirtupur had good FT shooting percentages but couldn't get to the line enough as they are both in the bottom for fouls drawn.
